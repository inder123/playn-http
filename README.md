playn-http
=========

Http extensions for the PlayN Framework. The PlayN framework's net package provides mechanisms to make HTTP calls. However, it is limited to GET and POST, and you can not pass HTTP headers or read response headers. That shortcoming is addressed by this project. You can create full HTTP requests with headers, read response status code or response headers.

Currently, only Android, iOS, HTML and Java backends are supported.
